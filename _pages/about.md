## About

I am a researcher at The Social Insurance Institution of Finland and a PhD student in Economics at Turku School of Economics.
My research interests are in health economics and empirical industrial organization. 
Specifically, I am interested in questions related to efficiency in health care provision, competition, and information technology.
